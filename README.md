# Jekyll Less Static Site Template

This is a forked version of [Jason Gritman's jekyll template](https://github.com/jgritman/Jekyll-Bootstrap-Template) modified to provide a layout driven by [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

Additional differences between this and the original are:

 * Better suited for static sites as opposed to just blogs.
 * YAML based menu configuration as part of __config.yml_.
 * Modified page layouts to include Sub category left rail.
 * Modified Bootstrap styles.
 * Rake tasks for compiling less. (Needs improvement to watch for changes in less)

A sample version of the template is available at http://blooming-rain-9089.heroku.com/

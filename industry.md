#Industry


###Market Size
The _*W*_orld _*H*_ealth _*O*_rganization estimates the overall worldwide healthcare market is the size of US $ 6 trillion.   Still in its embryonic state, theoretically the market potential for mobile patient healthcare support is enormous.

The North American market for remote health monitoring technology is posed to grow from $126.8 million in 2010 to $294.9 million in 2015, according to a report by Frost & Sullivan released in January, 2012.  Te report predicts that the growth in the remote health monitoring market will be driven by widespread use of telemedicine services and consumer-driven health care technologies.  

2011 was the first year of substantial business in the market for mobile health services delivered via smart phone applications, according to research2guidance (January 2012).   The firm says the main drivers for this growth have been the increase in the smart  phone user base on the demand side, and the doubling of the number of mHealth applications on the supply side.  It believes that the smart phone application based mHealth market increased by a factor of seven to reach $718 million in 2011.

Swedish research firm, Berg Insight, recently released a report finding that about 2.2 million people worldwide were using remote health monitoring devices by the end of 2011.  The report also found that the number of home health monitoring devices with embedded cellular connectivity increased from 420,000 in 2010 to 570,000 in 2011.  The report predicts that the number of such devices will reach 2.47 million by 2016.

###Rising Costs
Health expenditures in the United States neared $2.6 trillion in 2010, over ten times the $256 billion spent in 1980.  The rate of growth in recent years has slowed relative to the late 1990s and early 2000s, but is still expected to grow faster than national income over the foreseeable future, according to  the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  Since 2001, employer-sponsored health coverage for family premiums have increased by 113%, placing increasing cost burdens on employers and workers in the public sector. Hospital care and physician/clinical services combined account for half (51 percent) of the nation’s health expenditures.

###Senior Marketplace Statistics
* The older population is on the threshold of a boom.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau projections, a substantial increase in the number of older people will occur during the 2010 to 2030 period, after the first Baby Boomers turned 65 last year
* By 2030, 70 million Americans will be over the age of 65.  This is one out of every five Americans
* 30 percent of family caregivers caring for seniors are themselves aged 65 or over; another 15 percent are between the ages of 45 to 54 (HHS)
* After age 65, an American has more than a 70 percent change of needing help with the activities of daily living like dressing, bathing, and using the bathroom (American Society on Aging)
* The vast majority of adults (78 percent) in the U.S. who receive long-term care at home get all their care from unpaid family and friends.  Another 14 percent receive some combination of family care and paid help; only eight percent rely on formal care alone (Support for Family Caregivers)
* Long-term care is experiencing a substantial annual growth rate.  By 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services predicts an 83 percent increase in government spending alone.  By 2040, the long-term care market is projected to grow by 250 percent
* The U.S. population continues to age.  The median age (which divides theh population into two groups, half younger and half older) rose from 22.9 in 1900 to 35.3 in 2000 and its projected to increase to 39.0 by 2030 (Census bureau)
* About 80 percent of seniors have at least one chronic health condition and 50 percent have a tleast two.  Arthritis, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and respiratory disorders are some of the leading causes of activity limitations among older people (Census bureau)

###The Future
The future of healthcare will depend on the effective incorporation of digital technologies to streamline the practice of medicine and to decrease costs.  A core element of this strategy is the role of technology:

* Real time remote patient consultations;
* Remote monitoring of patients’ vital signs and conditions;
* The storing and forwarding of critical health information for analysis and diagnosis; and
* The wide availability of health information to patients and caregivers

A recent study by the Advanced Communications Law & Policy Institute (ACLP) found that Remote health monitoring resources help save $927 billion in healthcare costs for seniors and people with disabilities over the 25 year period between 2005 and 2030.  It also cited a study that said that telemedicine “could save the U.S. healthcare system $4.28 billion (annually) just from reducing transfers of patients from one location, such as a nursing home for medical exams at hospitals, physicians’ offices, or other caregiver locations.

Remote health monitoring also enables early disease prevention which can lead to enormous cost-savings.  It reduces the need for costly physician involvement, which can be adequately replaced, in many cases, by nurse practitioners and physician assistants.  The transition toward an electronic health infrastructure will also create new job opportunities for works.  A recent study estimates that an investment of $10 billion in health IT in one year would create or retain 212,000 U.S. jobs for a year.

These technologies enable the in-home remote monitoring of a variety of vital signs and other health metrics.   Such remote monitoring services enhance the comfort of the patient, provide real time data that can assist in more timely diagnoses, and facilitate a number of efficiencies and cost-savings.

Robert Litan wrote in his 2008 book Remote Health Monitoring Transmit Savings, Enhances Lives that “a full embrace of remote monitoring alone could reduce healthcare expenditures by a net of $197 billion (in constant 2008 dollars) over the next 25 years with the adoption of policies that reduce barriers and accelerate the use of remote monitoring technologies.

Another study showed that the U.S. Veterans Association, a leader in the use of remote monitoring, found that in-home chronic disease management tools (e.g. tele-consultations,  diabetes monitoring) resulted in 40 percent fewer emergency room visits and a 63 percent reduction in hospital admissions.

####Remote health monitoring:

* Enables delivery of critical healthcare services to remote and home-bound patients, facilitates enormous cost savings and empowers individuals by providing them with access to critical medical information.
* Facilitates the development of a new generation of telemedicine tools, services and devices which have bolstered healthcare in this country and resulted in measureable and significant cost savings to providers and patients.
* Shifts the healthcare paradigm towards more individualized and convenient care by, among other things, allowing for more robust in-home health monitoring and treatment.
* Creates impetus within the public and private sectors to spur innovation, deployment and use of telemedicine services across the healthcare industry.  

(New term:  Telehealth)

Competition in the global “telehealth” market  is expected to increase over the next 10 years, according to a white paper by health IT research group InMedica.  The paper, titled “Competitive Dynamics in the World Telehealth Market:  2011 to 2020” – researchers analyzed the current telehealth market and developed projections for the market’s future.  Key findings included:

* Data transmission suppliers, which provide information exchange technology for telehealth systems;
* Gateway suppliers, which provide telehealth hubs and user platforms; and
* Peripheral device suppliers , which provide remote monitoring devices such as blood pressure monitors and glucose meters that are used in conjunction with telehealth services.

The white paper predicts that competition in the telehealth market will increase as the entities attempt to expand the types of telehealth services they provide.  For example gateway suppliers might begin developing peripheral devices.  The report also predicts that competition will increase among data transmission suppliers as more cellular network providers and broadband suppliers enter the telehealth market.
